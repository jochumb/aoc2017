# Advent of Code 2017
Let's see how far I get with Elixir.

## Project setup
I chose to use an umbrella project. The apps folder contains has seperate Elixir applications for each day.
Additionally there is a Utilities project where commonly used functions are made available to all days.

## Execution
In the lib folder of each day my solution can be found. In the test folder the solver is run with the input.

Run `mix test` in the days project folder, or in the root dir to run the tests for all days.
